This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective document for the SNHU Travel Project. This artifact highlights the Agile and Scrum practices applied during the project, emphasizing teamwork, adaptability, and delivering high-quality software.

## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs requires active communication with stakeholders, understanding their goals, and translating these goals into clear, actionable requirements. Creating “user stories” facilitates this process by breaking down high-level needs into specific, user-focused features. For example, in the SNHU Travel Project, the user story “As a user, I want to filter destinations by budget and availability” ensured alignment between the Product Owner, developers, and testers. Wireframes accompanying the story provided a shared understanding of design and functionality, leading to an intuitive implementation.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to program development is iterative and user-centered, guided by Agile principles. During this project, I used processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to stay organized and responsive to changes. These practices, combined with tools like Jira and Kanban boards, streamlined development and improved efficiency. In the future, I plan to integrate practices such as continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) and automated testing to further enhance collaboration and quality.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member fosters collaboration, accountability, and respect within the team. This involves active participation in discussions, supporting team members in resolving blockers, and maintaining a shared focus on project goals. For example, during the SNHU Travel Project, daily stand-ups provided opportunities for team members to highlight issues, share progress, and collaborate on solutions. Cross-functional collaboration, such as pair programming, strengthened the team's ability to deliver high-quality features efficiently.
